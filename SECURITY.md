# Reporting Security Issues

To report a security issue, please email any of the Verlite maintainers, with "VERLITE SECURITY" in the subject. The maintainer will reply with a confirmation that your report has been received.

A GitHub security advisory will be assigned. If desired, include your GitHub username in the message to be linked as a collaborator where you can follow progress toward a fix, and participate in any discussion; otherwise we will reply to your email when the status of the report changes, with a link to a pubic GitHub security advisory if applicable.
